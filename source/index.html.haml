      %h1 Why?

      %p It's highly likely that if you live in a cold climate area or frequent ski resorts, you have lost a glove. Dropped from the ski lift while texting, misplaced in the back seat of a rental car, or vanished along with the elusive missing sock -- that glove is gone.
      %p Annoyingly, only one glove goes missing leaving the other lonely. But you keep that single glove in hopes that one day it'll return.
      %p Let's face it -- <strong>it's not coming back</strong>.
